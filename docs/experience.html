With a combined half a decade of experience in the SU, we have spent our Stuyvesant careers working to create meaningful change for the student body. Outside of the SU (and even outside of Stuyvesant) we have been involved in our communities and in local organizations that have given us the skills necessary to excel in leading the SU. Here is a list of some of some of the work we’ve done and our accomplishments:

</p>

<li>Vishwaa fought to ensure that all students could wear sweatpants for physical education if they didn’t feel comfortable wearing shorts for religious/cultural reasons. </li>
                            
<li>Vishwaa has been highly successful in obtaining sponsorships since freshman year. These include deals with Dos Toros and the Brookfield Place Ice Skating Rink.</li>
