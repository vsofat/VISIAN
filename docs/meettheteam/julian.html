                            <p>Hi, my name is Julian, and I am running for Vice President with the VISIAN campaign. Since my Freshman year, I have led the External Affairs Department of the SU and devoted myself to working with external organizations to improve the lives of all Stuyvesant Students. I currently represent Stuyvesant at the Manhattan Borough Student Advisory Council (BSAC), Chancellor’s Student Advisory Council (CSAC), and at the NYU Metro Center’s Youth Technical Assistance Center for Addressing Disproportionality (YTAC-D). Being a part of the Student Union has been an amazing experience, and I’ve had the opportunity to learn from and work with amazing people while helping to improve Stuyvesant and the student experience.</p>
                            <p>
                                Outside of the SU, I work on campaigns for State Assembly and City Council, help run my neighborhood’s Block Association, and am a writer and photographer for the Opinions and Photo sections of the Spectator, respectively. </p>
                            <p>
In my free time, I love to travel, practice vinyasa yoga, and watch Broadway musicals. A fun fact about me is that I almost exclusively listen to music from the 1970s. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
I’m confident that our ticket will be able to bring meaningful change to the lives of every single student at Stuy, and I encourage you to vote for us. Our platform is built on transparency, accountability, and inclusivity, and we hope to form a lasting bridge between all members of the Stuyvesant community that make any achievements possible. 
                            </p>
