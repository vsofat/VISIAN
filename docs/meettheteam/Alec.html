                            <p>Hi! I'm Alec, and I am proud to say that I am one of the campaign managers for VISIAN 2020. I love reading, dancing, and jamming out to Broadway songs on the train. I am currently a part of the Congressional Debate team, participated in StuySquad Latin, and worked as a producer for SophFrosh SING! Additionally, I participate in competitive ballroom dance and cook in my free time.</p>
                            <p>
The reasons why I believe so staunchly in Vishwaa and Julianâ€™s campaign are the facts that they are not only incredibly experienced and knowledgeable, but they are also extremely passionate. In my first interactions with the two candidates, I was intimidated and taken aback by the sheer passion with which they spoke about their visions for the SU. They seemed as though they could talk for hours and hours on end. Their beliefs are deeply rooted in those of the student body. Although I personally don't have 20/20 vision, I am confident that after voting for VISIAN 2020, it will be crystal clear that they are the perfect people to lead the SU.
                            </p>
