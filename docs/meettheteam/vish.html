                                Hi Stuy!</p>
                            <p>
My name is Vishwaa Sofat and I am the presidential candidate for the VISIAN campaign. My high school experience has been defined by my participation in the Student Union and other leadership forums. </p>
                            <p>
Over the last three years, I have devoted myself to creating key changes at Stuyvesant but also beyond our school. Being a part of Student Union as Freshman Caucus President, Sophomore Caucus President and currently serving as Student Union Vice President, student representative on the SLT has allowed me to not only throw as a person and a leader but also witness key changes. I have also the opportunity to make an impact outside the school by my involvement in the Borough Student Advisory Council, Congresswoman Maloney’s Congressional Youth Cabinet as well as my work with the Indian Consulate. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
When I’m not writing policy proposals or sending emails, you can find catching up on Hindi and Punjabi movies or catching up on on my CS homework (sorry Mr. K). I am also involved in Model UN, Cricket, Big Sibs amongst other things. A fun fact about me is that I have lived in 4 different states and 2 different countries— a global citizen, if you would.
                            </p>
                            <p>
I have one last year to pursue and accomplish change and for that reason, I urge you to vote for our ticket. VISIAN is built around each and every one of you. It builds community and carries us all together as we seek reform. It changes the narrative around student leadership making us all equals in the process of achieving new heights. With your vote and support, it’ll soon be clear that 2020 VISIAN was the right choice. 
</p>
