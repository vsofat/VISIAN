                                Hi! I’m Katie, and I’m excited to be one of the campaign managers for VISIAN 2020! Throughout the year, I love to participate in dance showcases such as StuySquad and SING!, performing with both hip hop and STEP! I write for the Stuyvesant Spectator’s News Department, and in the spring, I compete as a flyer with the STUNT team and manage the Boys’ Varsity Volleyball team. I’m one of the board members of Stuyvesant Red Cross, but I also actively volunteer out of school to help the less fortunate residents of New York City!</p>
                            <p>
	I am confident in Vishwaa’s and Julian’s ability to follow through with their proposed policies. They are already well-established in the Student Union and have been successful with many of their previous projects despite the challenges they encountered. Their passion for the SU is unwavering and will continue to be reflected in their tireless efforts to improve our experiences as Stuyvesant students. The policies that they are pushing for in their campaign address the needs of the student body and are, most importantly, viable and well-grounded. Both candidates have demonstrated integrity in their past experiences with the SU, and I trust in their leadership to listen to and act upon the student body’s behalf.
                            </p>
