                                Hey! I’m Julie, and I’m one of the campaign managers for VISIAN 2020. My experience with the SU began this year in the Communications Department. I love being a part of the SU family and helping to promote transparency and awareness within the student body! I am also an active member of the Sophomore Caucus, where I have served as Director of Events for 2 years. Besides student government, I love to jump and flip on the Stuyvesant Girls Gymnastics Team! I have additionally been a member of the Stuyvesant Cheerleading Team and Outdoor Track Team. Outside of school, I really enjoy volunteering, spending time with family and friends, and cooking. A fun fact about me is that I love cheese, but unfortunately can’t have any!</p>
                            <p>
I firmly support Vishwaa and Julian’s campaign due to their strong leadership capabilities and a thorough, well-rounded platform. They are both grounded in the SU and have plenty of experience; additionally, their dedication to improving Stuyvesant and helping the student body is undeniable. VISIAN’s proposals include many reasonable and achievable ideas that work to improve the lives of all students at Stuyvesant. For example, they came up with a comprehensive plan to improve the connections between students and the guidance department. With policies like these, I have no doubt that Vishwaa and Julian will work around the clock during the 2019-2020 school year to help make our Stuyvesant experience even better! :)
                            </p>
