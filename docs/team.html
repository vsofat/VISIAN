                                                <h3>Vishwaa Sofat, Presidential Candidate</h3>
                                                <p>Hi Stuy!</p>
                                              <p>
                                                  My name is Vishwaa Sofat and I am the presidential candidate for the VISIAN campaign. My high school experience has been defined by my participation in the Student Union and other leadership forums. </p>
                                                
                 <p>                               
Over the last three years, I have devoted myself to creating key changes at Stuyvesant but also beyond our school. Being a part of Student Union as Freshman Caucus President, Sophomore Caucus President and currently serving as Student Union Vice President and student representative on the SLT has allowed me to not only grow as a person and a leader but also pursue key changes. I have also had the opportunity to make an impact outside of Stuyvesant through my involvement in the Borough Student Advisory Council and Congresswoman Maloney’s Congressional Youth Cabinet, as well as my work with the Indian Consulate. </p><p>
When I’m not writing policy proposals or sending emails, you can find catching up on Hindi and Punjabi movies or catching up on on my CS homework (sorry Mr. K). I am also involved in Model UN, Cricket, and Big Sibs amongst other things. A fun fact about me is that I have lived in 4 different states and 2 different countries — a global citizen, if you would.</p><p>
                                        I have one last year to pursue and accomplish change and for that reason, I urge you to vote for our ticket. VISIAN is built around each and every one of you. It builds community and carries us all together as we seek reform. It changes the narrative around student leadership making us all equals in the process of achieving new heights. With your vote and support, it’ll soon be clear that 2020 VISIAN was the right choice.</p>

                                                <h3>Julian Giordano, Vice Presidential Candidate</h3>
                                                <p>Hi, my name is Julian, and I am running for Vice President with the VISIAN campaign. Since my Freshman year, I have led the External Affairs Department of the SU and devoted myself to working with external organizations to improve the lives of all Stuyvesant Students. I currently represent Stuyvesant at the Manhattan Borough Student Advisory Council (BSAC), Chancellor’s Student Advisory Council (CSAC), and at the NYU Metro Center’s Youth Technical Assistance Center for Addressing Disproportionality (YTAC-D). Being a part of the Student Union has been an amazing experience, and I’ve had the opportunity to learn from and work with amazing people while helping to improve Stuyvesant and the student experience.</p>
<p>Outside of the SU, I work on campaigns for State Assembly and City Council, help run my neighborhood’s Block Association, and am a writer and photographer for the Opinions and Photo sections of the Spectator, respectively. 
In my free time, I love to travel, practice vinyasa yoga, and watch Broadway musicals. A fun fact about me is that I almost exclusively listen to music from the 1970s.</p><p>
                                                I’m confident that our ticket will be able to bring meaningful change to the lives of every single student at Stuy, and I encourage you to vote for us. Our platform is built on transparency, accountability, and inclusivity, and we hope to form a lasting bridge between all members of the Stuyvesant community that make any achievements possible. </p>

                                                <h3>Alec Shafran, Campaign Manager</h3>
                                                <p>Hi! I'm Alec, and I am proud to say that I am one of the campaign managers for VISIAN 2020. I love reading, dancing, and jamming out to Broadway songs on the train. I am currently a part of the Congressional Debate team, participated in StuySquad Latin, and worked as a producer for SophFrosh SING! Additionally, I participate in competitive ballroom dance and cook in my free time.</p>
                            <p>
The reasons why I believe so staunchly in Vishwaa and Julian’s campaign are the facts that they are not only incredibly experienced and knowledgeable, but they are also extremely passionate. In my first interactions with the two candidates, I was intimidated and taken aback by the sheer passion with which they spoke about their visions for the SU. They seemed as though they could talk for hours and hours on end. Their beliefs are deeply rooted in those of the student body. Although I personally don't have 20/20 vision, I am confident that after voting for VISIAN 2020, it will be crystal clear that they are the perfect people to lead the SU.
                            </p>

                                               <p>Hi! I’m Deven and I’m a campaign manager for VISIAN 2020! This year, I have been the head of project management for the freshman caucus where I have been meeting with the administration to have policies enacted to benefit Stuy students. Outside of the SU, I am a part of the Stuyvesant Boys’ Basketball and Volleyball teams and was a member of Stuy SAYA.  I really like listening and playing music and I know how to play guitar and double bass. A fun fact about me is that I like biking in the city. </p>
                            <p>
                            
                            
I have faith in Vishwaa and Julian to lead the SU and have their proposals be implemented in our daily lives. They both have a lot of experience in SU and have already been introducing change such as the updated cell phone policy. Vishwaa and Julian also have specific plans for the future in getting their policies passed and their effects on the student body so the most people possible can benefit. Vishwaa and Julian are both hardworking and eager candidates that will work relentlessly to have the student body’s voices heard to make Stuy a stronger community for everyone.

<p>
                                Hey! I’m Julie, and I’m one of the campaign managers for VISIAN 2020. My experience with the SU began this year in the Communications Department. I love being a part of the SU family and helping to promote transparency and awareness within the student body! I am also an active member of the Sophomore Caucus, where I have served as Director of Events for 2 years. Besides student government, I love to jump and flip on the Stuyvesant Girls Gymnastics Team! I have additionally been a member of the Stuyvesant Cheerleading Team and Outdoor Track Team. Outside of school, I really enjoy volunteering, spending time with family and friends, and cooking. A fun fact about me is that I love cheese, but unfortunately can’t have any!</p>
                            <p>
I firmly support Vishwaa and Julian’s campaign due to their strong leadership capabilities and a thorough, well-rounded platform. They are both grounded in the SU and have plenty of experience; additionally, their dedication to improving Stuyvesant and helping the student body is undeniable. VISIAN’s proposals include many reasonable and achievable ideas that work to improve the lives of all students at Stuyvesant. For example, they came up with a comprehensive plan to improve the connections between students and the guidance department. With policies like these, I have no doubt that Vishwaa and Julian will work around the clock during the 2019-2020 school year to help make our Stuyvesant experience even better! :)

                                Hi! I’m Katie, and I’m excited to be one of the campaign managers for VISIAN 2020! Throughout the year, I love to participate in dance showcases such as StuySquad and SING!, performing with both hip hop and STEP! I write for the Stuyvesant Spectator’s News Department, and in the spring, I compete as a flyer with the STUNT team and manage the Boys’ Varsity Volleyball team. I’m one of the board members of Stuyvesant Red Cross, but I also actively volunteer out of school to help the less fortunate residents of New York City!</p>
                            <p>
	I am confident in Vishwaa’s and Julian’s ability to follow through with their proposed policies. They are already well-established in the Student Union and have been successful with many of their previous projects despite the challenges they encountered. Their passion for the SU is unwavering and will continue to be reflected in their tireless efforts to improve our experiences as Stuyvesant students. The policies that they are pushing for in their campaign address the needs of the student body and are, most importantly, viable and well-grounded. Both candidates have demonstrated integrity in their past experiences with the SU, and I trust in their leadership to listen to and act upon the student body’s behalf.
                            </p>

I love singing and acting, which is why I’m a really active member of the Stuyvesant Theater Community (STC). I’ve also been in the cast of SING! for the past three years and I sing in Stuy A Cappella. Besides performing, I also love helping others. I’m one of the Big Sib Chairs for the 2019-2020 school year and I help run Stuy Summer Tutoring, an organization that works with libraries around the city to help elementary school students improve their ELA and math skills. A fun fact about me is that I love hot Cheetos, and I eat them with chopsticks (it’s the only way to avoid staining your fingers!).</p>
                            <p>
I really believe in Vishwaa’s and Julian’s ability to lead the Student Union, and you should too! You can’t deny that they have the most previous SU knowledge and experience, and their proposed ideas for the coming school year are not only going to improve students’ lives, they’re also grounded in specific plans. I know that they’re both extremely passionate about our school and that they’ll work tirelessly to make it a better and happier place!
